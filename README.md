# C++ Auto Timer
A C++ timer that automatically measures wall time and prints the output upon destruction.

It is based on [`auto_cpu_timer`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/timer/doc/cpu_timers.html#Class-auto_cpu_timer) from [`boost::timer`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/timer/doc/index.html), but it doesn't require boost (doh), and it only shows the wall time.
